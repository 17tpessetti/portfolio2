                <h2>Burma Center Website and Career Assessment Test</h2>
                <p>During my time at Kelloggâ€™s, I worked with the Burma Center, a nonprofit organization based out of Battle Creek, MI whose goal is to empower Burmese Americans through advocacy and outreach. Our task was to develop a Career Assessment Test for their youth program as well as to re-design their website. I worked as a UX/UI specialist on this project and was part of the team that designed the algorithm for the Career Assessment Test and the visual aspects of the website.</p>

                <p>I worked alongside other interns, as well as a team within IT, in order to service fleets of trucks traveling throughout the United States and Mexico. I served a Product Management role in which I utilized my resources to meet the needs of our various stakeholders and put a plan into a pilot process by the end of my internship.</p>

                <h2>Project Gatorsync</h2>
                <p>Through Project Gatorsync, IT interns partnered with the sales organization in order to create an application to help them in their day-to-day work. As a Project Manager, I was able to exercise my leadership skills while implementing an Agile framework as a SCRUM Master. Also, this project allowed me to gain business skills by working cross-functionally with sales.</p>
