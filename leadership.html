                <h2>Michigan Running Club</h2>
                <p>The Michigan Running Club is the club Cross Country and Track and Field team at the University of Michigan. We compete year-round as a part of the National Intercollegiate Running Club Association (NIRCA). Last year, our team won the Men’s and Women’s Cross Country National Champion titles, the Men’s Track and Field National Champion title, and the Women’s Track and Field Runner-Up award. This is my third year of membership with the club, and my second year as a part of our leadership board.</p>

                <h2>Joyböl Campus Ambassador</h2>
                <p>I spent the 2018-2019 school year as a University of Michigan Ambassador for the Joyböl brand. Joyböl is the Kellogg Company’s newest brand - a portable smoothie bowl that can be eaten anywhere at any time, just by adding water! Throughout this experience, I held campus tasting events in which students could sample the product and receive discount codes to buy it online. This experience taught me a lot about branding and spreading messages via advertisement and social media.</p>

                <h2>Race Across Michigan</h2>
                <p>Over the past two years, I have participated in Race Across Michigan (RAM). RAM is a 24-hour, nonstop relay from Detroit, MI to South Haven, MI. A group of 70 runners participates yearly to run all the way across the state, hence the name “Race Across Michigan.” The purpose of the event is to raise money for the Special Olympics of southeast Michigan. Throughout the fall and winter, we volunteer with the Special Olympics at youth basketball, poly hockey, and track and field practices. On top of this, we raised over $30,000 last year, and we hope to raise even more this year!</p>

                <h2>Michigan Campus Band</h2>
                <p>I have been playing Bass Clarinet in the University of Michigan Campus Band since January 2017. Our band practices weekly and performs for the University of Michigan students and faculty, the Ann Arbor community, and the general public once per semester. This experience has allowed me to have a creative outlet in which I express myself outside the classroom.</p>
